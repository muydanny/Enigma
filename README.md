# Enigma

The year is 1942 and Alan Turing and his team just cracked the 'unbreakable' code of the Enigma machine.

Flash forward 78 years and the complexities of the enigma machine can be simplistically created within an advance bite size "Turing machine."

This project does just that.


# Functionality - 3
The Enigma class has a functioning encrypt and and decrypt method. After much work the command line interfaces are also successful. If time permitted the cracking method and command line interface would also be installed.


# Object Oriented Programming - 3
The project is broken up into  logical components. There are no unnecessary classes with  long lines  of code.

# Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 4
Most of the enumerables and data structures are the right ones for the job.

# Test Driven Development -  3
Unfortunately no mocks or stubs were used but I'm glad to say I was able to work around that and effectively test random generated numbers. I also found TimeCop on stackoverflow which allowed to "freeze" time.

# Version Control - 4
I have 45 commits and commented on every PR as a form of self review. I created a branch for every class and broke it up into logical chunks.
